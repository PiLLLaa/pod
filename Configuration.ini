
; Download logic
; ==============
; The filter file is downloaded and then copied to PoD filter direectory (the filter is named as its declared in sections below).
;
; Update check logic
; ==================
; 1. Date HTTP header cannot be used in determining if file is newer in the server (which hosts the filter file),
;    as based in my experiments the date is same as the current date despite the fact the file has not been updated in the
;    server.
; 2. At least the github doesn't give modified HTTP header, so to that the update logic cannot rely on either.
; 3. Github does give ETag HTTP header, but reddit does not unfortunately (some filters are hosted in there).
;
; If server (where the filter file is located) supports ETag HTTP headers, then that is used exclusively in determining
; if file is updated in the server.
;
; If the server does not support ETag http headers, then the content length and calculated Sha256 are used. BUT in order
; to be able to calculate the sha256, the file needs to be downloaded entirely first. The content length alone cannot be
; used, as its possible that user has made modifications to the installed filter file just so much that the content length
; matches to the one in the server, and then this application would incorrectly assume the filter has no update.
;
; download_url: URL location for the actual filter file
; home_repo_url: URL location for the filter file's home (repository, reddit page..)
; server_etag: If the server (which hosts the filter file) supports ETag headers, then this field will contain the value when it was checked for the last time
; downloaded_etag: If the server supports ETag headers, then this field will contain the value when the filter file was downloaded
; downloaded_sha256: sha256 which is calculated from the downloaded filter file
; installed_sha256: sha256 which is calculated from the filter file which is located in PoD's filter folder
; server_content_length: filter file's content length when it was last time checked
; installed_content_length: filter file's content length in the Pod filter directory
; description: Filter file description
; selected_for_updates: valid values are true/false (or empty). If value is true, then filter is overwritten with new version which was downloaded
